## **Corporate Back Brief:** Determining if OPC should acquire Ord Cycles and include it in OPC’s portfolio or stores.

Conducted several PostgreSQL queries in Azure Data Studio to support my back brief. These queries should provide insight into the data and help answer the overarching question: 
Should OPC take Ord Cycles on in acquisition and include them in their portfolio? You should strive to answer the following three business problems in your work.
- A. Does OPC have adequate sales to support continued growth in the mountain bike segment?
- B. Will the acquisition of Ord Cycles require OPC to increase the number of warehouses to meet demand?
- C. Should Ord Cycles be acquired, what configurations of mountain bikes should OPC require Ord Cycles to build based on available data?
